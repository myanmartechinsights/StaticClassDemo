# Static Class in C# with Real World Examples

Static classes are often used for creating utility or helper classes that provide general-purpose functions or constants.They contain static members only, such as static methods, fields, properties, or events.


## The solution will contain four projects as below:

- MathUtilities Project
- Config Project
- OtherExamples Project
- UnitTests Project

Each project will contain its own class implementation and corresponding unit tests using MSTest.


## Solution Structure

- MathUtilitiesExample

        Classes: MathUtilities       

-  ConfigExample

        Classes: Config       

- OtherExamples

        Classes: Logger        
        Classes: StringHelper       
        Classes: DatabaseConnection    
        Classes: GlobalConstants      
        Classes: DateHelper
     
- UnitTests
        
        Tests: MathUtilitiesTests    
        Tests: ConfigTests    
        Tests: LoggerTests        
        Tests: StringHelperTests       
        Tests: DatabaseConnectionTests      
        Tests: GlobalConstantsTests       
        Tests: DateHelperTests
